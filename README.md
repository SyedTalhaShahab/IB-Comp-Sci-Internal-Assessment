## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure
- Make sure the directory is exactly the same 
- STEP 1 [press] open VSCode
- STEP 2 [press] ctrl + shift + p
- STEP 3 [click] create java project
- STEP 4 [click] no build tools
Make sure you click /ApartmentApplication2.0 as your Java location

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
